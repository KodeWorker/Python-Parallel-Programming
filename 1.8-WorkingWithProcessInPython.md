## Working with Processes in Python

### What is a Process?
- It is an executing instance of an application
- A process can consist of multiple parallel threads
- Starting the browser, the operating system creates a process and begins executing the promary threads of the process

### Python Programming with Process
- On common operating systems, each program runs in its own process
- A process has its own space address, data stack, and other auxiliary data to keep track of the execution
- The OS manages the execution of all processes

## Working with Threads in Python

### What is a Thread?
- A thread is an active flow of control that can be activated in parallel with other threads within the same process
- Each thread can execute a set of instructions independently and in parallel with other processes or threads
- They share space addressing and then the data structures
- A thread is sometimes called a lightweight process
- The implementation of a thread is less onerous than that of a real process

### Processes Versus Threads
- A process can consist of multiple parallel threads
- The creation and management of a thread by the operating system is less expensice in terms of CPU's resources than the creation and management of a process
- Threads are used for small tasks, whereas processes are used for more heavyweight tasks (execution of operations)
- The threads of the same process share the address space and other resources, while pcoresses are independent of each other

### Threads and Python
- Thread-based parallelism is the standard way of writing parallel programs
- The Python interpreter is not fully thread-safe
- In order to support multithreaded Python Programs, a global lock called the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is used
- Only one thread can execute the Python code at the same time
- Python automatically switches to the next thread after a short period of time
- If multiple threads attempts to access the same data object, it may end up in an inconsistent state
- Keep track of all running threads! It could cause pain while running a big process
