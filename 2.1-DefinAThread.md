## Implementation

### Defining a Thread

#### The Python Threading Module
- Python manages a thread via the threading package
- It provides some very interesting features that make the threading-based approach easier
- The threading module provides several synchronization mechanisms that are very simple to implement

#### The Major Components of the Threading Module
- The thread object
- The Lock object
- the RLock object
- The semaphore object
- The condition object
- The event object

#### Defining a Thread
- The simplest way to use a thread is to instantiate it with a target function and then call the start() method
- The Python module threading has the Thread() method

#### Syntax to Define a Thread
class threading.Thread(group=None, target=None, name=None, args=(), kwargs={})
- group should be None; reserved for future extension when a ThreadGroup class is implemented.
- target is the callable object to be invoked by the run() method. Defaults to None, meaning nothing is called.
- name is the thread name. By default, a unique name is constructed of the form “Thread-N” where N is a small decimal number.

### Determining the Current Thread
- Instantiating a thread with a target function

### Using a Thread in a Subclass
- Defining a new subclass of the Thread class
- Overriding methods
- Creating a new subclass

#### Implement a New Thread Using the Threading Module
- Define a new subclass of the Thread class
- Override the \__init__(self, [,args]) method to add additional arguments
- Override the run(self, [,args]) method to implement what the thread should do when it is started
