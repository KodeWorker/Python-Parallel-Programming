### Thread Synchronization with Lock

#### Why Lock()?
- When two or more operations belonging to concurrent threads try to access the shared memory, a race condition can occur
- The easiest way to get around the race conditions is the use of lock
- The operation of a lock is simple when a thread wants to access a portion of shared memory, it must necessarily acquire a lock on that portion prior to using it
- After completing its operation, the thread must release the lock that was previously obtained
- The impossibility of incurring races is critical as the need of the lock for the thread

#### Deadlock
- A deadlock occurs due to the acquisition of a lock from different threads
- It is impossible to proceed with the execution of operations
- Let's think of a situation wherein there are two concurrent threads


                    Thread A        Shared Variables    Thread B

    Thread A waits  ┌──────────┐                        ┌──────────┐    Thread B waits
    for variable 1  │┌────────┐│    ┌────────┐          │┌────────┐│    for variable 2
    to be set by    ││  Wait  ┼┼───>│   1    │<  /──────┼┼  Set   ││    to be set by
    Thread B        │└────────┘│    └────────┘ \/       │└────────┘│    Thread A
                    │┌────────┐│    ┌────────┐ /\       │┌────────┐│
    Thread B can't  ││  Set   ┼┼───>│   2    │<  \──────┼┼  Wait  ││    Thread A can't
    set variable 2  │└────────┘│    └────────┘          │└────────┘│    set variable 1
                    └──────────┘                        └──────────┘
#### Advantages of Lock()
- It allows us to restrict the access of a shared resource to a  single thread or single type of thread at a time
- Before accessing the shared rescource of the program, the thread must acquire the lock and must then allow any other threads access to the same resource

#### Recap
- Locks have two states: Locked and unlocked
- We have two methods that used to manipulate the lock: acquire() and release()

#### Rules
- If the state is unlocked, a call to aquire() changes the state to Locked
- If the state is locked, a call to acquire() blocks until another thread calls release()
- If the state is unlocked, a call to release() raise a Runtime Error exception
- If the state is locked, a call to release() changes the state to unlocked

#### Disadvantages
- The locks are subject to harmful situations of deadlock
- They have many other negative aspect for the application as a whole
- It is conservative approach but introduce more unnecessary overhead
- It also limits the scalability of the code and its readability
- The use of a lock is in conflict with the possible need to impose the priority of access to the memory shared by the various processes
- An application containing a lock presents considerable difficulties when searching for errors

### Thread Synchronization with RLock
- Introducing a class with methods add and remove
- How to carry out the RLock() call within the class

#### RLock()
- Use a RLock() object, if we want only the thread that acquires a lock to release it
- The RLock() object has two methods: acquire() and release()
- It is useful when you want to have a thread-safe access from outside the class use the same methods from inside the class
