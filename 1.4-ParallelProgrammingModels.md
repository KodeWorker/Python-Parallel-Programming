## Parallel Programming Models

### Models for Parallel Programming
- The shared memory model
- The multithread model
- The distributed memory/message passing model
- The data parallel model

### The Shared Memory Model
- The task share a single shared memory area
- Mechanisms allow the programmer to control the access to the shared memory (locks and semaphores ...)
- Advantage - Programmer does not have to clarify the communication between tasks
- Disadvantage - It becomes more difficult to understand and manage data locality
- Keeping data local to the processor that works on it conserves memory accesses, cache refreshes, and bus traffic

### Multithread Model
- A process can have multiple flows of execution
- Used on shared memory architectures (should take care of synchronization issues)
- The current generation CPUs are multithreaded in software and hardware
- The Intel Hyoer-threading technology implements multithreading on hardware
- Parallelism can be achieved from this model

### Message Passing Model
    ┌───────────────┐                    ┌───────────────┐
    │   Machine A   │                    │   Machine B   │
    │ ┌───────────┐ │                    │ ┌───────────┐ │
    │ │ task 0    │ │                    │ │ task 1    │ │
    │ │           │ │                    │ │           │ │
    │ │ [ data ] ─┼─┼────────────────────┼─┼>[ data ]  │ │
    │ └───────────┘ │                    │ └───────────┘ │
    │   send()      │                    │   send()      │
    │ ┌───────────┐ │       NETWORK      │ ┌───────────┐ │
    │ │ task 2    │ │                    │ │ task 3    │ │
    │ │           │ │                    │ │           │ │
    │ │ [ data ] <┼─┼────────────────────┼─┼─[ data ]  │ │
    │ └───────────┘ │                    │ └───────────┘ │
    │   receive()   │                    │   receive()   │                          
    └───────────────┘                    └───────────────┘

- It is applied in the case where each processor has its own memory
- It requires the use of (ad hoc) software libraries to be used within the code
- Some of the implementation in 1980s, but standardized model was implemented in mid 90s (MPI).
- The MPI model is designed clearly with distributed memory

### The Data Parallel Model
- More tasks operate on the same data structure, but each teask operates on a different portion of data
- To implement this model, a programmer must develop a program that specifies the distribution and alignment of data
- The current generation GPUs operates high throughout with the data aligned
